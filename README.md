# Calculator_1

the interface at the beginning of the program is only to display how to use color text in python and create pretty complicated pattern using print() in python.the second part of the code uses exception handling and infinite loop to allow the user to have more freedom over the console.they can exit the program whenever they desire.enjoy the code
